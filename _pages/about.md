My name is **Amélie Royer**, I am currently working as a Research Engineer at [Kyutai Labs](https://kyutai.org/), a new AI lab committed to Open Science, and based in Paris, France.

Prior to this, I was a Deep Learning Research Engineer at Qualcomm AI Research from 2021 to 2024, working on neural networks efficiency using conditional compute and dynamic sparsity.

I also graduated with a PhD at the Institute of Science and Technology Austria (IST Austria) in 2020, working on Machine Learning and Computer Vision, and I obtained my Masters degree in Computer Science from "École normale supérieure de Rennes" (ENS Rennes, France) in 2015.
