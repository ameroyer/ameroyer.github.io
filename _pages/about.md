My name is Amélie Royer,

I recently graduated with a PhD at the Institute of Science and Technology Austria (IST Austria). Before joining IST, I graduated from "École normale supérieure de Rennes" (ENS Rennes, France) with a Masters Degree in Computer Science.

My main research interests are Machine Learning and Computer Vision, with an emphasis on Domain Adaptation problems and model interpretability.
