My name is Amélie Royer,

I am a research engineer at Qualcomm, working on neural networks model efficiency.
Prior to this, I graduated with a PhD at the Institute of Science and Technology Austria (IST Austria) in 2020, working on Machine Learning and Computer Vision, with an emphasis on representation learning and domain adaptation problems. Before joining IST, I graduated from "École normale supérieure de Rennes" (ENS Rennes, France) with a Masters Degree in Computer Science.
